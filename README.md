# What is 4C?

4C stands for **Cool Communities of Content Creators**, and the core idea is this:

**having a decentralized community of content creators who support each other and grow together, by making collaborations and events, and talking about the struggles of being a Content Creator.**

Decentralized because usually in a community, a single person, usually the founder, creates a server and informs people about what they do. Now, nothing wrong with that, it‚Äôs even deserved because creating a free and open community is a lot of work, money, and energy. But this is **not** the idea I had when I founded 4C. I wanted to create a community where everyone could participate and talk about creating content, and I would have been just a very active member, as I‚Äôd be in any community I‚Äôd be a member of.

In 4C, you can create your own 4C event, with the logo, and the colors and we will also provide in promoting it in the community. And of course, there are some rules and these events should always be accepted by staff members.

So this is the core idea.

The Community is currently Active on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/4ccommunity)** and **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/4ccommunityhq)**. This is enough for now but we will expand in the future.

# What 4C is not

An important disclaimer: Although many of us are developers, probably because Developers are great at making communities, **this is not a developers-exclusive community** (hence the name Cool Community of Content Creators). We are just focused on the process of Content Creation, how to get better at making videos, writing articles, and making Twitter Spaces. In the future, we might have different types of content creators, because we are focused on talking about HOW to create content, not development. Having said this, many activities and things are related to tech, and this is totally fine for now. We are just open to any kind of YouTubers, Writers, Podcasters

# Meet the Community Managers

At the top of the community, we have community managers. 

The current community managers for 4C are 
[Jax](https://twitter.com/44JAX44) 
[Avie](https://twitter.com/AvieDev). 

Community managers are people who take care of the community itself, especially the Discord Community. So they discuss the structure, nominating the Staff Members, who are the core of the community. 

___
# The Structure of our Server

The structure is always a work in progress. We try to add new ways of interaction to elevate the community while maintaining a beginner-friendly experience, and helping everyone

The server basically consists of four main sections:

- Welcome
- News/updates
- Main Hub
- Off-topic
- Self-promotion
- Projects

Every section ends with voice channels related to the purpose of this section.

___
## Welcome

In this section, we have:

üõë rules-and-info: All the server rules and information can be found here

üí≥ get-roles: to Make sure to take all the roles that interest you to stay up to date with all the news and events

___
## News/Updates

üì¢ community-announcements: All the announcements regarding our community

üì¢ events-announcements: Announcing the events of all our members here. Twitter spaces, YouTube lives, ETC.

üëã newcomers: People recently joined the server


___
## The Main Hub

This is where we do all the heavy conversations about content creation. It starts with introductions and then into the general chat.

General chat is what connects the server together, it is mainly about content creation but can also stretch to more general concerns.

Twitter chat is one of many specific social media platforms that we're going to introduce. Discussions here are all about Twitter from a content creation perspective.

YouTube chat is another super channel for creators who post content on YouTube. Share your analytics (if you want), and get insights on how the platform works as a whole. In short, networking with other YouTubers can never be bad.

The discussion forum is the main and only forum on the server where people can seek all forms of help. It has a powerful search function and it‚Äôs better to ask specific questions as the question will not be bumped off by another conversation as it would in general chat

The audio channels in the main hub are all about community gatherings, be it the 4C hall or the open coffee chat

## **The Off-Topic section**

This section is all about bonding together as a community on a more personal level.

Random chat is everything that doesn't go into General chat, sharing random daily pics and discussions about more broad topics.

The memes channel is self-explanatory and the bot commands is a channel to spam everything related to bots on the server so we don‚Äôt spam other channels where meaningful discussions are happening

The counting game is just a game where you count to some specific number (the goal count is regularly updated). It‚Äôs a good way to invite newcomers to start interacting with the server. Being the person to reach a certain count gives you a role that you can flex!

The audio channels here are all about 1 on 1 coffee chats

## **The Self-Promotion section**

We created a section dedicated to self-promotion so we can keep the other parts of the server clean and have all advertisements in one place.

This section is hidden behind level 3 and level 10 to avoid spammy people who just join discord servers to spam and leave (You get levels as of now by chatting in the server).

There are specific channels per type of content like articles, videos, Twitter, Insta, and those are hidden behind level 10.

We have one general content channel, an events channel, and a GitHub channel behind level 3. This will allow newcomers to share everything they are preparing as content creators.

On top of it all an achievement channel where people can brag about the things they have accomplished.

These channels have slow mode enabled and people can send messages once every 15 min (excluding the achievement channel which is 1 min). It is set this way to avoid spam and to invite people to share what‚Äôs really relevant.

The audio channel in this section is all about streaming, open for anyone who wants to stream something to the community

## **The Projects Section**

The 4C website promotes 1 project for all the active members. Some projects are worked on in the community. The 4C website is an open-source project that is handled within the community for example.

Another project is the spaces lounge, also a project maintained and handled within the community.

As well as the Free web3 project, which is also open source, and a great resource for anyone who wishes to start learning Web3. 

This section also has a chat for people who want to discuss their projects. The audio channel is mainly for meetings held regarding projects.

## **Projects**

In 4C, we want to have some projects and create content out of them. Members can suggest their own projects. For now, there is no restriction but we are working on filtering just the good ones, and maybe we will have a limit of projects we currently have. You can see the current projects [here](https://www.4c.rocks/projects).

To add a new project, you can contact Tobiloba or make a PR to the [project](https://github.com/FrancescoXX/4c-site/).

### **Free Web3 resources**

This project started on December 19, 2021, and it was just me saving the daily content I was creating. But then it turned into a list of free resources to learn web3. Web3 should be accessible to everyone, and this is the goal of this project: to make the life of those who want to learn Web3 and blockchain technologies easier.
